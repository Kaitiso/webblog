## ⛩️ The Shrine I Didn’t Mean to Build ⛩️

- Honestly... i didn’t plan to make a blog at all. I was just surfing the internet, doing nothing important ~as usual... Then, out of nowhere, i saw this theme… with Reimu Hakurei from Touhou Project
- And that was it, my brain went “Welp, i guess i have to do something with that thing. For my beloved Reimu.”
- Now somehow, i have a blog. I guess that’s what they call an incident.

### ☕ The Lazy Coder’s Confession

- To be honest, i’m not good at coding. Half the time, i have no idea what tf i’m doing. The other half, i’m debugging code i broke five minutes ago.  
- I’m lazy af, if there’s no incident, i just… do nothing. But the moment something fun, i’m suddenly full of energy. Like Reimu seeing donation money or me discovering a pretty Reimu theme for my site. ( ˘͈ ᵕ ˘͈♡)  


### 🌸 Coding Feels Different This Time

- Usually, i just code because i ***"Have to"*** like assignments, projects, deadlines,...

- But this time, while setting up the blog, something felt different. Maybe because it didn’t feel like work, it is more like decorating a small shrine for myself.  
 
- Maybe this is what it means to have fun while coding… 
though somehow it will be probably broken again soon ᗜ⁔ᗜ

### 💭 So... What’s Next?


- I don’t know. Maybe i’ll post something someday, about coding, games or just random thoughts when i’m not too lazy.  

- For now, i just want to enjoy this feeling, the rare moment when coding actually feels fun, like Reimu counting her donation money with a tiny smile.

- Anyway... i’ll leave it here before i break something again. Incident over.
