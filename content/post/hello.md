## ⛩️ The Shrine I Didn’t Mean to Build ⛩️

- Honestly... I didn’t plan to make a blog at all. I was just surfing the internet, doing nothing important ~as usual... Then, out of nowhere, I saw this theme… with Reimu Hakurei from Touhou Project
- And that was it. My brain went “Welp, I have to do something with that thing. For my beloved Reimu.”
- Now, somehow, I have a blog. I guess that’s what they call an incident.

### ☕ The Lazy Coder’s Confession

- To be honest, I’m not good at coding. Half the time, I have no idea what I’m doing. The other half, I’m debugging code I broke five minutes ago.  
- I’m lazy af, If there’s no incident, I just… do nothing. But the moment something fun, I’m suddenly full of energy. Like Reimu seeing donation money or me discovering a pretty Reimu theme for my site. ( ˘͈ ᵕ ˘͈♡)  


### 🌸 Coding Feels Different This Time

- Usually, I just code because I ***"Have to"*** like assignments, projects, deadlines,...

- But this time, while setting up the blog, something felt different. Maybe because it didn’t feel like work, it is more like decorating a small shrine for myself.  
 
- Maybe this is what it means to have fun while coding… 
(though I’ll probably break it again soon ᗜ⁔ᗜ)

### 💭 So... What’s Next?


- I don’t know. Maybe I’ll post something someday, about coding, games or just random thoughts when I’m not too lazy.  

- For now, I just want to enjoy this feeling, the rare moment when coding actually feels fun,like Reimu counting her donation money with a tiny smile.

- Anyway, I’ll leave it here before I break something again. Incident over.
